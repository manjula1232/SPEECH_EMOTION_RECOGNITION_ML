Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
This repository contains an implementation of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), which aims to classify emotions from spoken audio signals. SER models can help analyze vocal emotions in various applications, such as virtual assistants, customer service, and mental health monitoring.

Features:
Emotion Classification: Identifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, and more from audio input.
Pre-trained Models: Includes models trained on public datasets like RAVDESS, IEMOCAP, or custom datasets.
Audio Processing: Features preprocessing techniques including MFCC, Spectrogram extraction, and noise reduction.
Deep Learning: Utilizes state-of-the-art neural networks such as CNN, RNN, or transformers for emotion classification.
Real-time Prediction: Supports live audio emotion recognition using a microphone or pre-recorded audio files.

Technologies:
Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, librosa, scikit-learn
Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation
Flask/Streamlit for web-based demo

Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the demo: python run_demo.py
Use provided scripts for training, testing, and evaluating custom models.

Datasets:
The repository supports multiple public datasets, or you can use your own audio data for training.
Example datasets: RAVDESS, IEMOCAP, TESS
How It Works:
The model extracts features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from audio data, which are then used by a neural network to classify the emotion. The deep learning model is trained on labeled emotion datasets to predict the emotion expressed in new audio samples.
